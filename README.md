gridimagesearch
===============

Searches images and displays them


[Done]    User can enter a search query that will display a grid of image results from the Google Image API.

[Done]    User can click on "filter" which allows selection of advanced search options to filter results. 
          The filter icon is used for this.

[Done]    User can configure advanced search filters such as:
          - size : spinner
          - type : spinner
          - color : spinner
          - site : text


[Done]    Once configured, next search uses those filters

    
[Done]    User can click on the thumbnail and it will open up a new view with the full image.

[Done]    User can scroll down “infinitely” to continue loading more image results (up to 8 pages)

[Done]    Advanced: Used the ActionBar SearchView or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText

Ran out of time but I will continue to work on the remaining advanced features.
